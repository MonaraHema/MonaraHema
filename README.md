#  MonaraHema

**helloo yes welcome to my github i guess**  
i do silly stuff with code sometimes and then put it here.  
none of this is serious. half of it probably broke. the other half? cursed but it works.

> "not a furry btw" – me, lying probably

##  brain ideas (maybe someday??)

- uwu-to-normal text converter (anti-uwuifier)
- cursed tamagotchi in the terminal
- random joke API that only returns bad puns
- a web game where you throw files into the void
- fake OS that runs in the browser and gaslights you
- something in java... maybe... java is painfull
- something else in lua.... less painfull
